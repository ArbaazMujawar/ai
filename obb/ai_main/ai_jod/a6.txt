Explain

Symptoms and Diseases Data:
symptoms is a list containing common symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, and sore throat.
diseases is a dictionary where each key is a disease, and the corresponding value is a list of symptoms associated with that disease.
get_user_input Function:
The get_user_input function prompts the user for input about each symptom in the symptoms list.
If the user responds with 'y' (yes) for a symptom, it adds that symptom to the user_symptoms list.
After asking about all symptoms, it returns the list of symptoms reported by the user.
diagnose Function:
The diagnose function calls get_user_input to collect the user's symptoms.
It then iterates through each symptom reported by the user and checks if any disease in the diseases dictionary has that symptom.
If a disease is found that matches the user's symptoms, it adds that disease to the possible_diseases set.
Finally, it prints the possible diseases that match the user's symptoms or a message indicating that no matching diseases were found.
Main Function (main):
The main function serves as the entry point of the program.
It prints a welcome message and instructs the user to answer questions about their symptoms.
It then calls the diagnose function to perform the symptom checking and disease diagnosis.
Example Usage:
When the program is run, it welcomes the user and asks questions about symptoms.
The user responds to each question with 'y' or 'n' to indicate whether they have that symptom.
Based on the user's responses, the program diagnoses possible diseases that match those symptoms and prints the results.
