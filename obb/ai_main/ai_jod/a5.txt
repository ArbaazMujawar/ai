Explain

get_response Function:
The get_response function takes a user_query as input and checks if it matches any predefined responses.
If the user_query matches a predefined response (e.g., "hi", "how are you", "bye", or specific queries about warranties like "screen", "battery", etc.), it returns the corresponding response from a dictionary (responses).
If the user_query does not match any predefined response, it checks for specific keywords like "screen", "battery", etc., and returns the corresponding warranty information.
If none of the above conditions are met, it returns a generic response indicating that it didn't understand the query.
Main Function (main):
The main function is the entry point of the program.
It welcomes the user and provides instructions on how to use the chatbot.
It then enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input (user_query).
If the user enters "bye," the loop breaks, and the chatbot says goodbye.
Otherwise, it calls the get_response function to get the chatbot's response based on the user's input and prints the response.
Example Usage:
When the program is run, it starts by welcoming the user and providing instructions.
It then waits for the user to input a query.
Depending on the input query, the chatbot responds with the appropriate warranty information or a predefined response.
The chat continues until the user enters "bye," at which point the program exits.
